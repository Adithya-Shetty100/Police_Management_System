PROBLEM STATEMENT


This project deals with creation of a database of the police management system.
It has information about-Officers, cases, complaints, complainants, arrests and criminals.
Tables have been formed on each and the ER diagram establishes the relationship between the entities and attributes.
The project also demonstrates the performance of certain operations like create, select, delete, update, read, trigger, functions and many more.
We have used github, streamlit, python and xampp to execute the same.
There are screenshots of the table after performing each operation along with the sql query command for the same.
